A Python program that matches job descriptions with preprocessed resumes by leveraging semantic embeddings and cosine similarity. This program preprocesses both job descriptions and resumes, generates embeddings using spaCy, calculates similarity scores, and ranks the resumes based on their relevance to the job description. It offers clear output with candidate names, resume filenames, and similarity scores in percentage format for easy interpretation.
